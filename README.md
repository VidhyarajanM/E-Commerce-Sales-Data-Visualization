## E-Commerce Sales Data Visualization Project

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data from an e-commerce platform using **Python (Google Colab)** for data preprocessing and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing sales data from an e-commerce platform. The analysis includes:

- Revenue trends by time (month, year)
- Performance of product categories and sub-categories
- Geographic distribution of sales
- Profitability and discount impact
- Segment and region-wise performance

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** – Data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Google Colab** – Jupyter Notebook in the cloud
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard and business reporting
- **Excel** – Preprocessing of sales data

## Exploratory Data Analysis (Python Highlights)

Key steps in the Google Colab notebook include:

- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, checked for nulls, converted columns to appropriate types.
- **Sales Insights**:
  - Sales peaked during November and December (holiday season impact).
  - The **Consumer** segment contributed the highest sales volume.
  - **West and East** regions dominated overall profits.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Line charts for monthly sales trends
  - Heatmaps showing profit by category and region
  - Bar plots for top-selling sub-categories

## Power BI Dashboard

A detailed Power BI dashboard was created using the preprocessed data. It includes:

- Sales and profit over time
- Segment-wise and region-wise performance
- Category & sub-category breakdown
- Filter options for year and region

## Key Business Insights

- **Technology** was the most profitable category.
- High discounts led to a significant drop in profit, especially in the Office Supplies category.
- The **West** region had the highest contribution to overall sales and profit.
- Sub-categories like **Chairs** and **Phones** were top performers.

## How to Use This Project

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` folder to explore the analysis.
2. Use the Excel file in the `data/` folder for custom exploration.
3. Launch the Power BI file from the `reports/` folder to interact with the dashboard.
